# Summary

This is a Next.js project that allows users to upload CSV files, perform computations on the data, and display the results in a table format. It also maintains a history of the computations and allows users to show or hide previous tables.

## Notes

- The project uses CSS Modules for styling, which requires that all selectors be locally scoped. This means that each selector must contain at least one local class or id.

- The `CSVTable` component is responsible for displaying the table, handling the history of computations, and managing the visibility of previous tables.

- The `CSVUploader` component is responsible for handling the file upload and parsing process.

- The `temp.js` file appears to be an extra file, and its purpose or functionality is not clear. It might be worth reviewing or removing if it is not needed.
